            <h2>About Our Lab</h2>
            <p>The Labour Process and Technology Lab (LPT Lab) explores the intersection of <strong>work, automation, and digital transformation</strong>. We study how new technologies shape workers' lives, redefine power dynamics in the workplace, and influence collective action. Through a combination of critical research and participatory inquiry, we examine how unions, worker movements, and other collective forms of resistance engage with, adapt to, and challenge technological shifts in the workplace. Our goal is to imagine and create more equitable, just, and worker-centered futures in the digital age.</p>
            <p>The LPT lab is part of the <a href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca/">Faculty of Information</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>.</p>
