<p>This is Vera Khovanskaya's website. I am a <a href="https://cifellows2020.org">Postdoctoral Computing Innovation Fellow</a> at UC San Diego. I study the role of data tools and technical expertise in workers advocacy organizations. My recent work has examined how unions used workplace data in the past and how contemporary data tools impact organizing in the present. I also study how worker-centered software is built, specifically attending to the ways that contemporary pathways for technology innovation militate against worker-centered and community-driven technology design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My research combines qualitative, quantitative, community-driven, and design research approaches with historical analysis in order to make arguments about the long-term implications of applying technical expertise and data-driven methods to address problems in the workplace. My goal is to support workplace activists, organizers, and advocactes in accessing and building data tools to accomplish their goals in a sustainable and democratic way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At UCSD, I work with <a href="https://communication.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/irani-lilly.html">Lilly Irani</a>. I am a member of the Department of <a href="https://communication.ucsd.edu">Communication</a>, the <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu">Design Lab</a>, the <a href="https://communication.ucsd.edu/research/groups/feminist-labor/index.html">Feminist Labor Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://justtransitions.ucsd.edu">Just Transitions Initiative</a>. At Cornell, my thesis advisor was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/sengers/">Phoebe Sengers</a>. My dissertation committee also featured&nbsp;<a href="http://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen EC Levy,</a> <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/adam-seth-litwin">Adam Seth Litwin,</a> and <a href="http://lynndombrowski.com/">Lynn Dombrowski</a>. I am an alumna-member of the Culturally Embedded Computing Group, <a href="http://cemcom.infosci.cornell.edu/">CEmCom</a>.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I am not currently teaching courses. In graduate school, I was instructor (solo and co-instructor) and TA for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/sengers/teaching/INFO4240/">INFO/STS 4240: Designing Technologies for Social Impact.</a> In summer 2018, I co-organized a <a href="https://impact.infosci.cornell.edu/">summer school</a> on technology and social impact. In summer 2017, I taught <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info1100_2017su/">INFO1100</a>, an introductory programming course for non-majors in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>I am in the process of updating my website with pre-prints of my work. Until then please email me for a .pdf of anything that has my name on it.<br /><br />Email me at vkhovanskaya at ucsd dot edu. <br /><br />I exist more substantially on <a href="https://twitter.com/saysvera">Twitter.</a></p>
